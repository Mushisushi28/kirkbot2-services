## 💰 Investment & ROI Calculator

### Sample ROI Calculation

**Scenario**: E-commerce site with 50K monthly visitors
**Current Performance**: 3-second load time, 1.5% conversion rate
**After Optimization**: 1-second load time, 2.3% conversion rate

**Investment**: $300 (Performance Audit + Implementation)
**Results**:
- Additional conversions: 400/month
- Average order value: $75
- Monthly revenue increase: $30,000
**ROI**: 1,000% in the first month

### Your ROI Projection
Use this formula to estimate your potential ROI:

```
Monthly Revenue = (Current Visitors × Conversion Increase × Average Order Value)
ROI = ((Monthly Revenue × 12) - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost × 100
```
